## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Vechicel lenghth and groupd clearance will provide a non random amounth of varance because has a small p-value
Vechicel weight, spoilter angle, and AWD will provide a random amounth of varance because has a large p-value

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not? 

No, because of the p-value is smaller than 0.05

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
The modle will predict at a 71.49% accuracy

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
The entire mfg lots meet the design specicafication bacause the variance is 62.29 PSI which is within the 100 PSI requirement.
lot 1-2 pass, lot 3 doesn't

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
compare the p-value for each lot

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

What metric or metrics are you going to test?
cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.

What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
Null Hypothesis: MechaCars have no difference in pricing compared to its competitors based on its perforamce of key factors.

Alternative Hypothesis: MechaCars have different pricing in comparison to competitors based onn its performance of key factors.

What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
Mutiple linear regresstion to compare differce factors to the selling price


What data is needed to run the statistical test?
we'll need data on cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.
